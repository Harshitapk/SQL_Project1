# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
E-commerce database providing details about revenue by product and user interaction with website. 
This database is analyzed to get useful information about how visitor interacts with website and 
which products they want, varying across the globe by country and cities.

## Process
1. Import Data
Create new DB and tables according to given information in csv files
Import data from given csv files

2. Cleaning Data 
Create separate tables to clean data
Removing duplicates
Correcting data types
Identify unique values
Fill missing values
Drop empty/irrelevant columns

3.Observations
Product table has primary key on sku as all rows have distinct values
Above primary key can be referenced as foreign key in Sales_report_raw on productsku column
All_sessions and analytics does not have any column with distinct values. Each visitor gets a fullvisitorid and visitid tagged to it for each visit
All_sessions table provided data about how visitor interacted with site, how much time they spent , revenue generated by product or transaction , products belonging to which category,etc.
Data suggests that United States has the major consumer base for this site 

4.Quality Assurance:
Check details about column using information_schema.columns for appropriate datatype
Confirm distinct value in sku column of products table
Check missing data in columns considered in decision making
Update column value for consistent data if required

## Results
Data suggests that this website has consumer base concentrated mostly in United States. Usually Men's apparel
is the most visited category and YouTube is the favourite brand in United States. Also, Nest products were generally
bought in North American region than rest of the world.

## Challenges 
It was difficult to decide data type for some columns
Need to look for distinct value and remove duplicate data
Many columns had missing value so need to update accordingly
Product category had so much work to do in order to make conclusions depending on it

## Future Goals
Clean productcategory column further to get accurate result
Further understand relation among data of each table
Get more information by trying to answer more questions on what else could be inferred from data provided
